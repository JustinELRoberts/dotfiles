## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, the following should be installed:

1. Git (presumably if you cloned this repo, that is done)
1. [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/)
1. A [nerd font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads). I use Droid Sans Mono

## Usage

On MacOS, simply run `./install.sh` and follow the prompts; this will iterate over each directory in this repository and run the associated `install.sh` in it.
